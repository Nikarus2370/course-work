					If you predict that the faceup card will have a higher value than the facedown card, hit HIGHER.</br>
					If you think it will be lower, hit LOWER.</br></br>
					
					Ace is high card, 2 is low.</br></br>
					
					Score starts at 100.</br>
					5 points per play.</br>
					Winning once gets 8 points.</br>
					Continuing lets you roll </br>
					your points back in on the </br>
					next hand for a score multiplier.</br></br>
					Example. Winning a first hand gets 8 points at a cost of 5. Netting the player 3 points.</br>
					Rolling that 8 points back in and winning again would win 16 points, while still only costing 5. Thus netting the player 11 points.</br></br>
					
					*Note*</br>
					If a card appears blank, odds are it's the Ace of Diamonds. For whatever reason, adblocker likes to block that image. 
					You can continue playing the the adblocker on, or disable it. It's not detrimental to gameplay, however annoying it may be.
