				<h2>High low card game.</h2>
				2 cards will be dealt. 1 faceup, the other facedown.</br>
				Press HIGHER or LOWER to indicate if you think the value of the faceup card will be higher or lower than the facedown card.</br>
				Start off with a score of 100. It costs 5 points to play. Winning a single hand returns 8 points.</br>
				Winning hands can be rolled into later hands for a multiplier.</br></br>
				Example. Winning a first hand gets 8 points at a cost of 5. Netting the player 3 points.</br>
				Rolling that 8 points back in and winning again would win 16 points, while still only costing 5. Thus netting the player 11 points.

			<div>Currently both cards are shown at all times for this demo of the running code. In stylized complete version, the second card would be shown "facedown"</br>
			and have an animation "flipping" it when the player makes their high/low decision.</div>
